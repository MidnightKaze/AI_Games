health is calculated wrong - when attacked and when healing I guess lol
    - somehow when the enemy attacks you never lose an HP :D
        - jk. I think the def bonus is so op at the start you never lose HP
    - and when u heal you lose health lol
        - erm the code is a little weird, so I have literally no clue how to fix that
        - IT WORKS NOW

wait so like... u can just never find the artifact...
    - fixed it :D

so like does the SA ever recharge? that i do not know lol
    - i'm surprised it does
